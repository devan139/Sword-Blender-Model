🛠️ What I did:
- Designed a unique sword combining medieval elegance and fantasy elements
- Modeled the asset from scratch in Blender
- Textured and UV-mapped with glowing elements and engraved detailing
- Built material shaders using node-based programming
- Animated the sword with cinematic camera moves
- Final render and edits in Premiere Pro
💡 This project helped me dive deep into animation workflows, shader node connections, and material programming — a hands-on learning experience I truly enjoyed.
